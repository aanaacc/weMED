  <h2> Test Types </h2>
  <p> There are two types of tests currently available for COVID-19. A viral test is taken to see if you currently have the virus while an antibody test tells you if you have had it in the past. The viral tests include two different types of diagnostic tests, most commonly taken by a nasal or a throat swab. These tests can be taken at a clinic for rapid testing, at home with prescribed collection kits, or by saliva tests that allow patients to spit into a tube. Antibody tests are most commonly taken by a finger stick or a blood draw which will let you know if you have previously had coronavirus but is not meant to be used as a diagnosis of a current infection. Decisions about testing are made by state or local healthcare providers and differs by location. If you are looking to get a coronavirus test, the best way you can do so is by contacting your health care provider. You can also look on your state or local health department's website to look for the latest updates and locations for coronavirus tests and regulations. You can also use our COVID-19 Test Locations Map below to find the closest coronavirus testing locations quickly.</p>

  <h2> What Do Your Results Mean? </h2>
  <p>After getting tested for the coronavirus, you will be reciving your tst results shortly. What do those results mean? If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you should take the necessary protective steps to protect others in your home and community. After testing positive for the coronavirus, make sure yu stay at home except to get medical care. Most people with mild cases of COVID-19 can recover at home without medical care. If you have tested positibe, do not leave your home or visit public areas. If you are in a situation where you need to go get medical care, make sure to call before you go in and let them know that you have or may have COVID-19. To keep your friends and family safe, tell your close contacts that they may have been exposed to COVID-19. By letting them know, you are helping protect everyone. If you test negative for COVID-19, you most likely were not infected at the time that your sample was collected. However, this does not mean that you will not get sick or have not come in contact with a sick person since. To continue to keep yourself and others safe, make sure to limit your trips out of the house and always wear a mask in public settings. Continue to keep a distance of around 6 feet from those who do not live in your household and make sure to wash your hands often. Take care to clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.
