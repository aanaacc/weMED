    <h2>Understanding Medical Bills</h2>
      <p class="contentText">
      Instead of hiding your financial strain, talk about it. Avoidance only makes it worse. Medical billing departments understand what you are going through, and it is their job to help you. When you speak with these professionals, be sure to ask for their names. Getting it the first time makes it easier to communicate later on because that person already knows your story. Always respond to their calls and letters, and in turn, feel free to call or email them anytime. Communication is key, as it builds relationships and exchanges important information. Take advantage of the services your hospital's billing department has to offer. Your friends and family will be there as well to offer their support and encouragement. There is a whole community of people that are there for you. Use them.

      Medical bills tend to be confusing because  you may receive two or three statements from one visit to the hospital that are not the bill. The first statement most people get is from the hospital which predicts what the insurance company will pay and what they think the patient will have to pay, the Estimated Payment Responsibility; this is not a bill. The next statement should be from the insurance company indicating how much money they paid towards the hospital bills. This is called the Explanation of Benefits and again, is not a bill. Some people receive a third statement before their bill; however, most people get their bill at this point. This is the actual bill, and it will show what the insurance paid and what the patient has to repay. This can be a long process. Do not hesitate to contact your medical provider if you have any questions.

    <h2>Paying Medical Bills</h2>
      <p class="contentText">
      Although you may not be fond of doctors or the expenses that come with treatment, it is critical that you get treated. Your health is a greater priority than your money. Additionally, if you do not take care of yourself by going to the doctor, you are more likely to have severe medical problems in the future which will cost more money. Before paying any bills, think about how you are paying for them. If you plan on paying with a credit card, make sure you check your credit score and the amount of available credit remaining on your account. Typically payments using credit cards are meant to lessen the burden by spreading the payments over time. If payments are not made on time, you may have a higher interest rate, a late fee, or both. If this is a recurring event, the situation will only get worse. It is best to contact your medical provider even when you are unable to pay on time for greater flexibility. Calculate your budget <a class="contextLink" href="https://www.myfinancialgoals.org/education/income-and-expense-debt-calculator">here</a> to ensure your financial safety.

      Even though, it may be difficult to get by with bills piling up, do not take money out of your retirement fund. If you do, you will be charged a high interest fee and are essentially damage your future because you are taking away money that would usually gain value. Taking out loans is also not the greatest idea. Scheduling monthly payments and using a planned budget is the best idea. If you cannot afford this plan without extra help, feel free to ask for a hand from your peers. GoFundMe's are great resources for this. Places such as the Ronald McDonald Houses, which have many locations at different hospitals are also something to keep in mind. They provide a "home away from home" for families who are seeking treatment at a hospital far away from their house for free. Be careful how you spend your money and make sure you have searched all options before making a commitment.
