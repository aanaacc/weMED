<div class = "STIs">
  <h2> Sexually Transmitted Infections and How to Prevent Them </h2>
  <p> Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) are infections transmitted through sexual contact with almost 20 million cases every year in the United States. Common types of STI are <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chlamydia/">chlamydia</a>, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gonorrhoea/">gonorrhoea</a>, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/trichomoniasis/">trichomoniasis</a>, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/genital-warts/">genital warts</a>, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/genital-herpes/">genital herpes</a>, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pubic-lice/">pubic lice</a>, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/scabies/">scabies</a>, and <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/syphilis/">syphillis</a>. STIs present in common symtoms, including but not limited to unusual discharge from the vagina, penis or anus, pain when peeing, lumps or skin growths around the genitals or anus, a rash, unusual vaginal bleeding, itchy genitals or anus, and blisters and sores around the genitals or anus. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, go for a checkup at a sexual health clinic as soon as you can. Some clinics that offer these resources can be found on our Planned Parenthood Locations Map above. Make sure you are not participating in any sexual acts until you have gotten a checkup to prevent transmission to your partner. The only guaranteed way to not contract an STI is to not have any kind of sexual contract. Otherwise, you can practice safe sex by using condoms, internal condoms, and dental dams.</p>

  <div class = "contraception">
    <h2> Birth Control and Contraception 
    </h2>
    <p> Birth control, commonly known as contraception, was designed with an intent to prevent pregnancy. There are many methods of birth control that you may choose from depending on factors such as your health, frequency of sexual activity, desire to have children in the future, and personal preference. These methods include methods that prevent sperm from reaching the egg, preventing the ovaries from releasing eggs that can be fertilized, IUDs, and sterilization. Condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and contraceptive sponges all work to block the sperm from reaching the egg. Birth control pills, patches, shots, vaginal rings, and emergency contraceptive pills work by keeping the woman's ovaries from releasing eggs. IUDs are inserted into the uterus and either prevent the sperm from reaching the eggs or by thickening the cervical mucus and stopping ovulation. Sterilization is a more premenat option that prevents a woman from getting pregnant or a man from being able to get someone else pregnant. Clinics such as Planned Parenthood provide services that allow you to inqure about or receive forms of birth control. The Planned Parenthood Locations Map above allows you to search quickly for clinics that provide these services near you. </p>
